                    <p>An L-System is a type of generative grammar (rewriting system), formulated by Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968. L-Systems were originally tasked for the modeling of the growth of plants, but when used in conjunction with turtle graphics, can be used to generate complex patterns of an interesting nature.</p>
                    <p>A context-free L-System falls in the category of the finite languages, and is composed of three parts:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A <strong>Alphabet</strong>, the set of all symbols used by the L-System.</li>
                        <li>A set of <strong>Productions</strong>, which define how each symbol is rewritten on expansion.</li>
                        <li>An <strong>Axiom</strong>, the initial string to which the set of Productions is applied repeatedly to generate subsequent generations.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>A set of example L-Systems may be found on the <a href="gallery.html">Gallery Page</a>.</p>
                    <p>An example L-System/Turtle Graphics combination is provided on the <a href="renderer.html">Renderer Page</a>.</p>
                    <p>An explanation of how symbols are interpreted by the turtle to generate an image is provided on the <a href="tokens.html">Tokens Page</a>.</p>

                    <p>"<b>CDC Data</b>" is a visualization of the relative prevalence of adults who admit to heavy drinking, who admit to driving after heavy drinking, and deaths related to driving while drinking. The deaths are accumulated from 2005-2014, while the surveys are from 2014. The visualization is a heatmap-style map of the United States, wherein each state has been colored according to their relative prevalence mapped onto a color scale. </p>
